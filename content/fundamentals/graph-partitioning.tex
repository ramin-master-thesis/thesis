\section{Graph Partitioning Techniques}
\label{sec:graph-partitioning-techniques}
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are many related works in partitioning a graph or more specificly a bipartite graph.
    \item In this work we focust to partition this bipartite graph using an embedding tool called StarSpac.
    \item In \cite{satuluri2020simclusters} the represent a technique to partition the graph beased on community detection between the users. They authors use the user-user birpartite graph to create communities to solve many personalization and recommendation problems at scale.
    \item Other approaches like graph embeddings discussed in \cite{goyal2018graph} can be used for cluster detection and node classifications.
    \item Although methods like \cite{grover2016node2vec} \cite{wang2016structural} perfore well in node classification, the whole graph needs to be loaded in memeory first. Where as in the proposed approch each node in classified speratley.
