\label{chap:fundamentals}
Setting the scene for a systematic review, this chapter aims to classify the relevant technologies, introduce essential concepts, and define terminology. To begin with, various recommender systems and different aspects of them are being discussed. Additionally, metrics were studied to evaluate recommendation systems. Secondly, GraphJet and its components, namely Storage Engine, Recommendation Engine, and the API Endpoint, are being reviewed. Next, different embedding models are being touched upon by mainly focusing on StarSpace, and dimension reduction approaches. Next, graph embedding frameworks, along with partitioning techniques, are introduced. Finally, hash functions and partitioning methods based on different functions are being explained.
