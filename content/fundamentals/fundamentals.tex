\chapter{Fundamentals}

This chapter defines central terminology and introduces essential concepts and technologies relevant to this thesis. This chapter is structured as follow:

The first section highlights all the aspects of recommender systems. Different groups of recommender systems are introduced and discussed. Continuing on this section, various metrics studied to evaluate recommendation systems are examined in detail. The first section ends with related work and an explanation of data fusion strategies.


The second section explains the real-time recommendation engine GraphJet. The section describes each component of GraphJet. Namely: Storage Engine, Recommendation Engine, and the API Endpoint. The deployment of GraphJet is described briefly. The section finishes with the related work and introduction to similar systems like GraphJet.


The following section takes different embedding models. It then goes through the details of StarSpace and different approaches to dimension reduction. The next section builds on top of this section and introduces graph embedding frameworks along with partitioning techniques.


The last section continues to explain hash functions. The section also opens up partitioning methods with different hash functions.
