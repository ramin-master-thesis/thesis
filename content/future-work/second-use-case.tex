\section{Second use-case: Tagging and Tag Recommendation for Stack Overflow Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The proposed approch can be used in other fields and use cases.
    \item A good use case would be Stackoverflow questions tag prediction.
    \item It exists a bipartite graph between the questions and tags. The edges between these questions determine if a question is related to a tag or not.
    \item We can use the same approach to partition the question-tag graph on mulptiple workers. With the difference that we store the embedding of each question on each worker.
    \item When a new question is created, StarSpace can calculate the embedding space of that particular question and furthuremore the partition number.
    \item After the partition is deffined we can used the stored embedding of the questions to find the most similar (i.e. "nearest") question to the newly created question. The most similar question would be the starting node on the question-tag bipartite graph for the SALSA random walk.
    \item The end result of the random walk would be a ranked list of tags for the new question.
\end{itemize}
