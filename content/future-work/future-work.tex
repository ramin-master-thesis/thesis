\chapter{Future work and outlook}
\label{chap:future-work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In this chapter I describe potential future work and outlook for the work.
    \item The fisrt section describes a load balancer profiting from the third data fusion approach described in subsection \ref{fig:data-fusion-highest-ineterest} that would readuce the requests sent to the workers.
    \item In the second part I propose a second use case that fits the approach of this work. This use case can be built and evaluated in another work.
\end{itemize}
