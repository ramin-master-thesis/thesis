\chapter{Future work and outlook}
\label{chap:future-work}
This chapter describes the potential future work and outlook for the proposed thesis. The main chapter introduced two ideas and assumptions interesting for future work. The first idea is the \emph{Load Balancer} proposed in section \ref{sec:load-balancing}. 


The load balancer provides a good starting point for discussion and further research. The recommendation latency and the memory usage of the load balancer need to be benchmarked. Another topic for the load balancer is how it affects the partitioning performance since it adds additional storage during partition time. 


One challenge I faced during the evaluation was the missing feedback on the test dataset. Therefore I assumed that all the results in the baseline are related items. This assumption makes the evaluation strict. Future research should further develop and confirm these initial findings using other datasets with feedback or investigate new approaches like A/B testing to evaluate such systems.


The second idea which can be evolved in future research is the \emph{Web UI Dashboard} suggested in section \ref{sec:web-ui}. Improving the dashboard can open new possibilities to evaluate the recommendation quality. 


\todo{would it be better if I move the section web ui and load balancer to here?}
