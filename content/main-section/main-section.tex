\chapter{Concept}

The concept chapter of this research is the actual exploration of the research problem proposed. The statements are supported and substantiated by the literature consulted in the previous chapter.

This chapter is divided into eight sections, each section describing the research ideas in detail. The first section explains the crawling strategy and how the tweet dataset is gathered together. Afterwards, the system architecture of the single partition and the multi-partition are introduced and discussed. The chapter continues describing the partitioning methods used to distribute the data. After that, the section explains how the StarSpace model is trained and how the training dataset is built. Then the three data fusion approaches are proposed and demonstrated. Finally, the last three sections present future ideas and improvement concepts adapted to the current proposed work.
