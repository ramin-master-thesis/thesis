\chapter{Concept}

This chapter is divided into eight sections; each section describes the research idea in detail and offers an in-depth and better exploration of the research problem. The statements are supported and substantiated by the literature discussed in the previous chapter. The first section explains the data crawling strategy and how the tweet dataset was gathered. Second, the system architecture of the single and the multi-partition are introduced and discussed. Then, it explains how the StarSpace model is trained and how the training dataset is built. Third, data fusion strategies are examined in detail. Finally, the last three sections present a future outlook and improvement in concepts adapted by the current research.
