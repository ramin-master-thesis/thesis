\section{Data crawling approach}
\label{sec:data-crawling-approach}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I used an open source data crawler to crawl the tweets\footnote{\url{https://github.com/philipphager/twitter-crawler}}.
    \item Although there were some changes needed to crawl the content of the tweets as well.
    \item The user that the crawler starts from is Elon Musks Twitter page\footnote{\url{https://twitter.com/elonmusk}}
    \item For each user:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Crawl up to 25 tweets from their timeline
        \item For each tweet, add the tweet author and retweeters (up to 500) to the crawling queue.
        \item Start over
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
