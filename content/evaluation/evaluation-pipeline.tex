\section{Evaluation Pipeline}
\label{sec:evaluation-pipeline}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Random users are sampled
    500 random users 
    
    \item Calculate recommendation for each sampled user on single machine
    Query a user N (=10) times and  take the most frequent recommendations
    This creates the objective ranks (i.e., Golden Standard)
    
    \item Calculate recommendation for each sampled user on single machine
    Check reproducibility of the results
    
    \item For every sampled user on each partition, calculate the recommendations
    observed ranks
    
    \item Assess the objective ranks with the observed ranks
    
\end{enumerate}
