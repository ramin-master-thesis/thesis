\section{Evaluation Suit}
\label{sec:evaluation-suit}
The \emph{Evaluation Suit} evaluates the implementation and the different approaches proposed in this work \footnote{\url{https://github.com/ramin-master-thesis/evaluation}}. The main propose of the evaluation suit is to measure the recommendation quality of the distributed system. The evaluation suit compares the golden standard with of the recommendations generated by the different data fusion approaches (explained in the section \ref{sec:data-fusion-approaches}) based on the partitioning method used (see section \ref{sec:partitioning}). It also assess other aspects of the system like the latency. The evaluation suit is highly configurabel and automates the evaluate process for different test scenarios. This section will explain how the evaluation suit is built and how it aids this work to compute the evaluation.


\subsection{Architecture and components}
\label{sec:eval-suit-architecture-components}
Figure \ref{fig:evaluation-suit-architecture} indicates an abstarct architecture of the evaluation suit and its components. The system takes a configuration file and the left side index of the graph (user to tweets index) as its input. The configuration file provides different parameters to the system to create different evaluation scenarios. The evaluation suit reads the configuration file and samples the users, generates a baseline (goleden standard list) from the sampled users. Next it fetches the recommendations from the partitions and computes the recommendation quality along with information of each partition. In the end the system outputs the results. Each of the following sub-subsection will go through the components and explain their functionality.

\subsubsection{Configuration file}
\label{subsubsec:config-file}
The evaluation suit can be configured by passing various parameters to the system using a configuration file. The full documentation of the parameters can be found in the main repository of the evaluation suit.
