\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
The evaluation of the system aims to determine how the distribution and partitioning of the data influence the output results. How good or bad the system performs. This chapter introduces the evaluation suite, which was implemented to benchmark the results of the multi-partition instance against the single partition instance.

The chapter continues with the latency evaluation. The experiments investigate the impact of partitioning over the overall recommendation generation latency. Afterward, an evaluation pipeline is introduced. The pipeline is designed to create different test strategies and evaluate the output results.

The final section of this chapter presents the results of the experiments and discusses the key results of the research done during this thesis.
