\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

The evaluation of the system aims to determine how the data distribution and partitioning influence the output results. To put it more simply, how well the system performs. This chapter introduces the evaluation suite, which was implemented to benchmark the results of the multi-partition instance against the single partition instance. The chapter continues with the latency evaluation. The experiments investigate the impact of partitioning over the overall recommendation generation latency. Afterwards, an evaluation pipeline is introduced, designed to create different test strategies and evaluate the output results. The final section of this chapter presents the results of the experiments and discusses the key outcomes of the research.
